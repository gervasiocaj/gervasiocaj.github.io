title: Building my libre.fm profile

My music subscription service is Deezer; it comes free with my data plan and has uses no data on 4G.
But I always envy everything Spotify offers, their playlists and features are far superior.
One feature in particular is "Year in Review", which basically displays a summary of the bands and genres you listened to and the time spent doing it.
I wanted to replicate it, but I had no raw data. So I had to gather it.

Last year, I had set up a IFTTT script that logged my Deezer activity to a Google Docs sheet.
