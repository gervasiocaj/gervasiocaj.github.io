Running applications from zero sucks.
I'm often alternating between Linux/Windows/macOS and configuring Apache or NGINX, mantaining several different DBMS, Node.js versions, etc. is a pain in the neck.
Thankfully, I was presented with Docker: it allows me to virtualize any environment seamlessly, on any operating system.
Docker-composer is also a wonderful tool, in which at just a glance it is possible to understand this environment and also add any dependencies like databases and plugins.
